INSTALL

Ensure that the ImageJ version is at least 1.5 and the installation has Java 1.8.0_60 (64bit) installed. If not download the latest version of ImageJ bundled with Java and install it.

The versions can be checked by opening ImageJ and clicking Help then About ImageJ.

Download the latest copy of Bio-Formats into the ImageJ plugin directory.

Place Dot_Distance.jar into the plugins directory of your ImageJ installation.

If everything has worked Dot_Distance should be in the Plugins menu.

Dot_Distance.java is the editable code for the plugin should improvements or changes be required.
